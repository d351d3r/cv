## Requirements and Compilation

* pdflatex + biber + pdflatex
* AltaCV uses [`fontawesome`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome) and [`academicons`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/academicons); they're included in both TeX Live 2016 and MikTeX 2.9.
* Loading `academicons` is optional: enable it by adding the `academicons` option to `\documentclass`.
* Use the `normalphoto` option to get normal (i.e. non-circular) photos.
* As of v1.2 you can add multiple photos on the left or right: `\photoL{2cm}{logo1}` and `\photoR{2.5cm}{logo2,photo}`. (`\photo` will work like `\photoR`.) Separate your image filenames with commas _without_ spaces.
* Use the `ragged2d` option to activate hyphenations while keeping text left-justified; line endings will thus be less jagged and more aesthetically pleasing.
* Can now be compiled with pdflatex, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX!
* However if you're using `academicons`, you _must_ use either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. If the doc then compiles but the icons don't show up in the output PDF, try compiling with LuaLaTeX instead.
* The samples here use the [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) font. Feel free to use a different typeface package insteadâ€”often a different typeface will change the entire CV's feel.
